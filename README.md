(note: this doesn't run in browser on a Mac because Godot 4 is broken. sorry!!)

I made the bulk of this during the GMTK 2023 game jam for the prompt "Roles Reversed". I had never worked in Godot before, so it was also a challenge to myself to learn a new language and program all in one shot. I was working full-time mentoring at a coding camp during it, so I wasn't able to devote the entire time to working on this, but I am proud of it nonetheless! 

I plan on realizing the full idea eventually by chipping away at it when I have time.
